# Inventory Management

Proper inventory management is essential for maintaining the freshness and quality of your products. Follow these instructions to manage your inventory effectively:

* Use a first-in, first-out (FIFO) system to ensure that the oldest products are sold first.
* Regularly check the stock levels and order new products as needed.
* Keep accurate records of the inventory to prevent overstocking or understocking.
