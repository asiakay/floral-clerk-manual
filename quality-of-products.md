# Quality of Products

It is essential to ensure that the flowers and plants sold in the floral department are of high quality and are fresh. Follow these instructions to maintain the quality of your products:

* Ensure that the flowers are properly hydrated and cared for.
* Check for any signs of damage or decay, and remove any damaged products from the display.
* Rotate the stock regularly to ensure that the oldest products are sold first and that there is always a good selection of fresh flowers and plants available.
