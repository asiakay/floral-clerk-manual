# Customer Service

### **Providing excellent customer service is crucial in the retail floral industry**. &#x20;

Be warm and approachable, extending a friendly greeting to customers with a genuine smile. Take a moment to introduce yourself, emphasizing your availability to provide assistance and address any inquiries they may have. Ask questions and listen to understand customers' specific goals, needs, and requirements.&#x20;

When a customer chooses to explore independently and declines assistance, kindly inform them about your availability should they require any assistance or when they are prepared to finalize their purchase.

Take opportunities to learn about the product inventory, floral arrangement design, and bouquet wrapping techniques in order to feel confident about providing the best possible service to your customers.
